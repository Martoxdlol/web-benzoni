2. **Fonts:**
   - Font files are in TrueType format (.ttf)
   - May need conversion to web formats (WOFF, WOFF2) for optimal web performance
   - Check font licensing for web embedding

3. **Content:**
   - Text content is in Spanish
   - Content is organized by service areas
   - Ready to be integrated into CMS or static site

### Next Steps for Web Development

1. Optimize images for web (WebP format, multiple sizes)
2. Convert fonts to web formats
3. Structure content into HTML/CMS
4. Implement responsive design based on 1280px artboard
5. Add SEO metadata
6. Implement booking/contact forms
